This is just a super simple, submodulized-mirror
of all entry gists for [coderack.org](http://coderack.org),
an awesome Ruby focused competition.

All items are under their respective licenses,
See their coderack pages for more info.

If you want your repo removed from here,
let me know but messaging me.

Most of all, good luck to all!
